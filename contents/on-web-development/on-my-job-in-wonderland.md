## How I met Wonderland Engine GmbH

After an awesome September on 2021 from the crypto universe, I finally had some money to buy without esitation my second VR headset.

To buy a Quest 2 from Facebook was a wonderful deep experience. I had been a delusional way to experimenting with the first VR from Playstation. For real I used as an ornaments close to the Playstation for years.

On default browser I everyday found webxr experiences suggested by Facebook and every single day I had for months Wonderland Engine

### Improved version from chatGPT

"After an exciting September in 2021 in the world of cryptocurrencies, I finally had enough funds to confidently purchase my second VR headset.

Acquiring the Quest 2 from Facebook was a truly immersive experience. Previously, I had dabbled with the first VR headset from PlayStation, but it mostly served as a decorative piece near my PlayStation for years.

On the default browser, I discovered daily WebXR experiences recommended by Facebook, and for several months, I found myself immersed in Wonderland Engine every single day."
