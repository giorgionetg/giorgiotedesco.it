## My trip along AI

### There is not really an entry point here. It's just a little story on my hobbies.

I started to develop around 2001. With html first (it's weird because html as you know it is not a programming language, but a *Hyper Text Markup Language*, I know, you know, everybody knows) and then moving to: **server-side with php**.

The most awesome part of coding that I love: it's to give "orders" or "homework" to a computer; write logic and check if everything works as expected and leave the computer solve task you have not anymore to do. **Coding** aka **Solving problems**, or maybe *generates another problems*, specially in a big library/project.

A fact I really believe it's that anyone can learn to develop. If you can think and solve problems, with coding and related stuff you can build whatever you want from app to a game, from little problem to the biggest one.

A common and well-known issue in computing is related to language and reasoning. Computers operate using binary states, represented by **0** and **1**. ***There is no ambiguity in that***. However, an important detail to note is that the actual voltage values on a circuit, PCB (Printed Circuit Board), and CPU (Central Processing Unit) are not strictly 0 or 1. If a system's operating voltage is 3.5 volts, a state of '0' represents no energy flow, while a '1' corresponds to a value close to 3.5 volts. This can sometimes be exactly 3.5 volts, but it can also fluctuate, perhaps being 3.49 volts or even 2.9 volts, due to variations in electrical characteristics. (written by chatgpt to improve meaning and understanding)

As you can see, nothing in nature or physics is related to absolute values; everything is involved in infinite values and scales. The same is true for human language. For example, from a philosophical perspective, if I mention **a tree**, you may draw upon your entire knowledge of what a tree is, **but you can never know exactly which tree I have witnessed**.

**This is perhaps the primary reason why I was drawn to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks: because all of them function in a manner closer to human nature. They do not become human, but they simulate behavior within a statistical framework.**

In this context, where everyone is afraid to lose his job for AI or AI it is a bad actor, all the theories we have on AI, just fall down as a flies. It's pretty christian or still phylosophical: we cannot create, only procreate. We cannot generate more energy from any source. We are limited and everything we create is limited against us. So, any kind of AI it preservs this assumption at the base.

## There is no need to be scared from AI




First we have to discover that everything on coding it's a function. It's about coding. It means:

```typescript 
// this function make a sum
const myFunctionAVG: (data: number[]) => number = () => {
    let accumulator: number = 0;
    for(numbers in data) {
        accumulator += numbers;
    }
    return accumulator;
}
```

Everytime we use this function the result it will be exactly the same (in this case also exactly right).

On the other hand, in Machine Learnind, Deep Learning and at the base Neural Networks will give a probability of results.
